## Project Overview
For the Restaurant Reviews projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In Stage One, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also begin converting this to a Progressive Web Application by caching some assets for offline use.

## How I have completed this project
1.Convert the provided site to use a responsive design using CSS and media queries  
2.Implement accessibility features in the site HTML  
3.Add a ServiceWorker script to cache requests to all of the site's assets so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline.
